# Best Way To Pass Tailwind Classes Inside Your React Components

## Introduction

Hello people, in this blog post i will show you the 
best/proper way to pass tailwind classes between your 
react components as props. Let's say you have a basic
react project with tailwind as styling tool. Most people
does it like this.

```tsx

interface MyComponentProps {
    className?: string;
}

export default function MyComponent({ className }: MyComponentProps) {
    return (
        <div className={"your-initial-classes " + className}>
            Lets pretend this is a useful content.
        </div>
    );
}

```

This is a working way yet not practical and it will slow you down as your app grows.

## Using clsx and tw-merge

For this solution first we need to install two packages.

```bash

npm install tw-merge clsx

```

After installing the packages we need to define a function like this.

```tsx

import clsx, { ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tw-merge";

function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
	return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}

```

We made our function and now we can use this util function wherever we want like this.

```tsx

import { cn } from "@/utils.ts";

interface MyComponentProps {
    className?: string;
}

export default function MyComponent({ className }: MyComponentProps) {
    return (
        <div className={cn("your-initial-classes", className)}>
            Lets pretend this is a useful content.
        </div>
    );
}

```

At first try it might seem like it doesn't do much work 
for you but having a consistent syntax for your classes
is really important for both of your productivity and time.
